# CHost

CHost is an open-source utility project focused on host, networking, and system-level tooling.  
It is designed primarily for developers and advanced users working in Linux- and Android-based environments.

The project aggregates various scripts and web-related components intended to support system-level tasks, experimentation, and custom workflows.
